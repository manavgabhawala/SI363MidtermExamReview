## MIDTERM REVIEW ##
When implemented correctly the app should exhibit the following behavior:
- Use the array to display the first how many ever cells, and the last cell should always be the image.
- These cells should have the contents of the strings. 
- Tapping any cell should shuffle all the cells. 
- Tapping the shuffle button should also shuffle the cells.
- The last cell should display the image downloaded.
